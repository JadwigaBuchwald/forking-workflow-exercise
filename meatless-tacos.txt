Ingredients

* 1 bottle Teriyaki marinade or sauce
* 1/2 pounds vegan meat alternative (shredded)
* 4-6 taco size flour tortillas
* 2 cups shredded Montery Jack cheese
* 1 1/4 cups cooked rice
* Tomato salsa
* Guacamole

Instructions

* Place the basic shredded vegan meat subsitute in a medium bowl, pour 1/2 
bottle of Teriyaki sauce into the bowl and mix well.
* Heat up tortillas in a medium pan with a little bit of butter on 
medium-low heat. While the tortilla is heating up, place a little bit of 
rice on the tortilla, then top with some cheese so the cheese will melt 
slightly.
* Take the tortilla/rice/cheese combo out of the pan and onto a plate.
* Top with Teriyaki vegan chicken, followed by tomato salsa and guacamole.
